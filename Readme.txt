These are the resources that you need to run the server. You'll need them to be in the root directory right next to the source.

Simply copy and paste resources to the root directory where the source is located.

Example:
Challenge TTF is your root directory.
Src is already in the root.
Just copy/paste resources into the root directory! Done!
